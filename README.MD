## Introduction

This project involves an intelligent autonomous 2-wheel robot car using the  Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, equipped  with  various  sensors  and a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller. The primary goal is to develop a robot car that navigates a predefined track, efficiently  avoiding obstacles and recognizing barcodes using infrared sensors. The integration of  a PID controller enhances the car's control system, ensuring smooth and accurate motion during navigation and barcode scanning.

## Getting Started

To get started with this car project, follow these steps: 

1.  **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine

3.  **Open Pico Visual Studio Code**: This project is designed to be built using Pico Visual Studio Code, a development environment optimized for Raspberry Pi Pico projects. If you haven't already, [download and install Pico Visual Studio Code](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/c_sdk.html#raspberry-pi-pico-cc-sdk) on your computer.
    
4.  **Open the Project in Pico VS Code**: Launch Pico Visual Studio Code, and use the "File" menu to open the cloned repository folder (`car-project`).
    
5.  **Build the Project**: With the project open, navigate to the build menu or use the keyboard shortcut to build the project. This will compile the code and generate the necessary binary files.
    
6.  **Upload to Raspberry Pi Pico**: After building the project, you can flash the generated uf2 file onto your Raspberry Pi Pico. Connect your Pico to your computer while pressing the white button and copy the uf2 file in.
    
7.  **Run the Project**: Once the code is uploaded to your Pico, you can *run* the car project and observe its behavior.
